# JS-Random-Person-Generator
a generator that generates random people with a bit of their random information

i don't see why anyway would need nor want this

i only put in three people

so you would randomly get three people if you click the generate button

and yes, all their information is the same

anyways,

you can edit the code and request a pull from me
